Privacy Policy

All Is Well does not collect, sell, or share personal data.

All data entered into the app (including client names, pet information, addresses, notes, photos, and schedules) is stored locally on the user’s device and, if enabled, synced securely via Apple iCloud using CloudKit.

Calendar access is used solely to create pet-sitting events in the user’s personal Apple Calendar. The app does not read calendar events unrelated to the app.

The app does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

Data is never transmitted to any external servers outside of Apple’s services.
